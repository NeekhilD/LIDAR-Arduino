# LiDAR-Mapper
A LiDAR 3D Mapping system which is very low cost at 5000â‚¹(~80$) made using arduino.
The PCB is there in the LA3DMS folder. There are some errors in the pcb but it can be fixed by using jumpers.
You'll need an extra power supply for the servo motors (if you use mg995, smaller servo will work fine) because the one on the pcb is not powerful enough.
Use an arduino or FTDI programmer for the UART communication to transfer co-ordinate data to PC.
Use the .pde file with processing IDE to visualise the data.
